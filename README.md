nix-config
==========

Nix configuration for the software I use.

## Install and configure software

```
./install.sh
```

## Native packages

Other packages are better installed using `aptitude` since Nix support is not great outside NixOS.

```
sudo apt install calibre docker docker-compose terminator
```
