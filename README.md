dotfiles
========

Configuration for all the software I use, ready for a fresh install.

## Install and configure software

```
./install.sh
```

## Native packages

Other packages are better installed using `aptitude` since Nix support is not great outside NixOS.

```
sudo apt install calibre docker docker-compose gimp gnome-tweak-tool terminator vlc -y
```
